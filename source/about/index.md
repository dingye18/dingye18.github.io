    _You must start with mathematics which, you know, is the foundation of our science. The scope is indicated in the program. Bear in mind that by "knowledge of mathematics" we mean not just all kinds of theorems, but a practical ability to integrate and to solve in quadratures ordinary differential equations,etc._
